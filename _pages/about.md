I am a 4 year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) now. I major in Physics and minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. In September, I will be a Ph.D candidate in [Shanghai Institute for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences](https://www.simis.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/).

In physics, I have learned theoretical mechanics(classical mechanics), quantum mechanics, QFT, general gravity and so on. 

In math, I have learned Lie groups and Lie algebras, PDE, ODE, mathematical analysis, higher algebra, real function, complex function, differential geometry, functional analysis and a little Riemannian geometry. 

Academic Interest
======
* Mathematical Phyisics

I am especially intersted in quantum gravity now. Quantum field and string theory are also my academic interests. Studying them in the aspect of Algebra and Topology may be my future dream job.

Now I focus on constructing a 'perfect' QFT in Feynman geometry, especially for gauge fields.
