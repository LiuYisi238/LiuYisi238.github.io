I am a 3 year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) now. I major in Physics and minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

In physics, I have learned theoretical mechanics(classical mechanics), quantum mechanics, general gravity and so on. Now I am learning Solid State Physics and reading the book: Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics. 

In math, I have learned ODE, mathematical analysis, higher algebra, real function, complex function, differential geometry and functional analysis. I read some books and gained some knowledge about algebra(abstract algebra) last summer vaction.


Academic Interest
======
* Mathematical Phyisics

I am especially intersted in quantum gravity now. Quantum field and string theory are also my academic interests. Studying them in the aspect of Algebra and Topology may be my future dream job.
