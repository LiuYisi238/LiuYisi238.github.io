I am a 3 year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) now. I major in Physics and minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. My academic interest is mathematical physics.

In physics, I have learned theoretical mechanics(classical mechanics), quantum mechanics and general gravity. Now I am reading the book: Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics. In math, I have learned ODE, mathematical analysis and higher algebra. Now I am learning real function, complex function, differential geometry and functional analysis. I read some books and gained some knowledge about algebra(abstract algebra) last summer vaction.
